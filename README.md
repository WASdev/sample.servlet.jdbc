JDBC Servlet Sample
==============

The ServletJDBCEngine sample contains a server definition for basic servlet support, and illustrates a simple datasource definition using an included configuration file. It uses Apache Derby (an open source relational database). Also included is a servlet which gets a connection to the database using the defined datasource, creates a table, inserts some data, retrieves the data, and prints the data out to the browser.

Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/JDBCApp](http://localhost:9080/JDBCApp).

## Running in Eclipse with Maven

1. Clone this project and import into Eclipse as an 'Existing Maven Project'.
2. Right click the project and select `Run As` -> `Maven Clean`.
3. Right click the project and select `Run As` -> `Maven Install`.
4. Right click the project and select `Run As` -> `Maven Build...` then run the goal `liberty:install-server`.
5. You should see the following in the console:
   `CWWKZ0001I: Application JDBCApp started in XX.XX seconds.`
    In your browser, enter the URL for the application: [http://localhost:9080/JDBCApp](http://localhost:9080/JDBCApp).
    In your browser, you should see the message:
    `Text retrieved from database is: myHomeCounty`

## Running in Eclipse with WDT

1. WIP

## Running with Maven

This project can be built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in][] to automatically download and install Liberty profile runtime from the [Liberty repository](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/). Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute full Maven build. This will cause Liberty Maven Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. To run the server with the Servlet sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```
