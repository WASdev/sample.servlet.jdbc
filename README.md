JDBC Servlet Sample [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.servlet.jdbc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.servlet.jdbc)
==============

The ServletJDBCEngine sample contains a server definition for basic servlet support, and illustrates a simple datasource definition using an included configuration file. It uses Apache Derby (an open source relational database). Also included is a servlet which gets a connection to the database using the defined datasource, creates a table, inserts some data, retrieves the data, and prints the data out to the browser.

Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/JDBCApp](http://localhost:9080/JDBCApp).

## Running with Maven

### Running in Eclipse with Maven

1. Clone this project and import into Eclipse as an 'Existing Maven Project'.
2. Right-click the project and select **Run As > Maven Clean**.
3. Right-click the project and select **Run As > Maven Install**.
4. Right-click the project and select Run As -> Run on Server.
5. You should see the following in the console:
   `CWWKZ0001I: Application JDBCApp started in XX.XX seconds.`
    In your browser, enter the URL for the application: [http://localhost:9080/JDBCApp](http://localhost:9080/JDBCApp).
    In your browser, you should see the message:
    `Text retrieved from database is: myHomeCounty`

### Running from the command-line with Maven

This project can be built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). The project uses the [Liberty Maven Plug-in] to automatically download and install the Liberty 
Java EE Web Profile 7 from [Maven Central]. The Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute full Maven build. The Liberty Maven Plug-in will download and install the Liberty server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. To run the server with the Servlet sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

## Running with Gradle

This project can also be built and run using [Gradle](http://gradle.org/). The provided `build.gradle` file applies the Liberty Gradle Plug-in and is configured to automatically download and install the Liberty Java EE Web Profile 7 runtime from [Maven Central]. The Liberty Gradle Plug-in also has tasks that create, configure, and run applications on a Liberty server.

Use the following steps to run the application with the Gradle wrapper. (Windows machines use `gradlew.bat`):

1. Execute the full Gradle build. The Liberty Gradle Plug-in will download and install the Liberty server.
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew clean build
    ```

2. To start the server with the JDBCApp sample run:
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew libertyStart
    ```

    Alternatively, execute the run command:
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew libertyRun --no-daemon
    ```

3. To stop the server, execute:
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew libertyStop
    ```  

Please refer to the [Liberty Gradle Plug-in] repository for documentation and configuration examples for the plug-in.
